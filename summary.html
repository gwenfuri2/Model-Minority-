  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
   The model minority myth can be false, inaccurate, and detrimental for many South Asian and other Asian American kids who do not fit the image,<br>
    struggle academically, or have special needs. This is especially true if it leads to them receiving less support than they require. <br> 
  The myth of the "model minority" argues that some ethnic minorities are superior to others in terms of assimilating to a new society, <br>
  being more diligent, and being academically talented. However, this misleading narrative has the potential to divide communities and <br>
    undermine mental health and other aspects of well-being. <br> </p>
  
  
          <p style="text-align:left;">
         Stereotypes of Asian Americans as a quiet, shy, and overly submissive, for example, are still prevalent. <br>
         Asian women are still presented as exotic and servile, while Asian men are frequently depicted as asexual, meek, and nerdy. <br>
             </P>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    The model minority myth's popularity, as well as its acceptance in American society, has caused some concerns regarding the impact <br>
    of these racial stereotypes on Asian Americans. Asian Americans appear to have more purchasing power, better education degrees,<br>
    higher standardized test scores, higher median income, own more homes, and save more money than other ethnic groups in the United States, <br>
    according to demographic profiles. Despite the fact that these demographic characteristics continue to fuel the model minority myth, <br>
    a closer study of the data reveals that Asian Americans have lower earnings than white Americans, despite their greater levels of schooling.<br> </p>
         
  <p style="text-align:left;">
   When it comes to technology, racial stereotypes place people in jobs that demand technical knowledge. Asian Americans are<br>
  rarely given the opportunity to work on tasks that can help them develop their strategic and leadership skills because <br>
  they are perceived as submissive worker bees. Without these opportunities, the glass ceiling becomes unbreakable.<br>
