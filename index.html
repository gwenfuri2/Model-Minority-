             It is essential to debunk the model minority theory. It is still misunderstood since it is part of the American exceptionalism issue. <br>
             Those who disagree with the characterization are frustrated by the protestant work ethic or the idea that success is solely due to human effort. <br>
             Because the stereotype appears to be positive, many innocent bystanders believe the MMS. Unwittingly, these individuals contribute <br>
             to the demonization of other ethnic groups. Wedge politics, meritocratic logic, and historical amnesia must all be understood by those <br>
             committed to social justice in higher education. They collaborate to provide reinforcement and promotion, both of which are difficult <br>
             to stop once they begin. The MMS is divisive and has a negative impact on all students of color, thus higher education should combat it. </P>
