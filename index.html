             It is necessary to disprove the model minority theory. It is still misunderstood since it is part of the American exceptionalism issue. <br>
          Those who disagree with the characterization are frustrated by the protestant work ethic or the idea that success is solely due to human effort. <br>
          Because the stereotype appears to be positive, many innocent bystanders believe the MMS. Unwittingly, these individuals contribute to the demonization <br>
          of other ethnic groups. Wedge politics, meritocratic logic, and historical amnesia must all be understood by those committed to social justice in <br>
          higher education. They collaborate to provide reinforcement and promotion, both of which are difficult to stop once they begin. The MMS is divisive <br>
          and has a negative impact on all students of color, thus higher education should combat it. <br> </P>

      Asian-Americans are portrayed as the ideal minority, with close ties to whiteness and the upper class.<br>
      Given the past and ongoing treatment of Asian-Americans in the United States, this is not always true. <br>
      Asian-Americans were socialized as an inferior, foreign type posing a threat to the Anglo-Saxon, Protestant <br> 
      race from the 1850s through the post-World War II era. </p>
