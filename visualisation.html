         The issues confronting the Asian community are emotionally draining, particularly for second-generation immigrants.<br>
    According to a National Center for Health Statistics report, Asian American women have the country's second highest suicide <br>
    rate, yet little scientific studies on suicide have been undertaken on the group. According to the Asian/Pacific Islander Domestic <br>
    Violence Resource Project, between 41 and 61 percent of Asian women will be physically and/or sexually abused by an intimate partner <br>
    at some point in their lives, but that barriers such as immigration status, language barriers, and a lack of culturally competent <br>
    services may prevent them from seeking help. <br> </P>

          In a 1966 article for the New York Times, sociologist William created the term "model minority." The term "model minority" refers to an ethnic <br>
            group that has succeeded despite being marginalized in the United States. The problem with this word, however, is that it ignores and avoids <br>
            the language of almost a century of widespread anti-Asian attitudes, prejudice, discrimination, and collective trauma. The model minority <br>
            myth simplifies the nuanced and varied identities and experiences of Asian Americans.Perpetual marginalization, treatment as outsiders, <br>
            alienation, racial and cultural trauma, immigrant and refugee experiences, as well as psychological suffering and emotional misery, <br>
            are all common themes in such situations. <br>

     On a quantitative skill assessment, Asian-American women's performance was examined as a function of whether they identified as Asian, female, or individual at <br>
     the time of testing. In previous studies, ethnicity salience was connected to increased arithmetic performance among Asian women. The researchers, on the other <br>
     hand, adopted a tiny ethnicity salience adjustment that is unlikely to have elicited concerns about group reputation or highlighted widespread cultural <br>
     stereotypes about Asians' mathematical prowess. We shifted the focus to ethnic identity in such a way that other people's high performance expectations <br>
     became more visible. In these situations, ethnicity salience produced a drop in concentration, which resulted in much worse math performance. <br> </p>
